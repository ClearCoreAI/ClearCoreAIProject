## [0.3.1] â€“ 2025-06-20

**Total waterdrop aggregation, LLM orchestration fixes, and improved developer onboarding**

### Added

- New route `/water/total` in the orchestrator to compute total waterdrop usage across all agents and the orchestrator.
- New `QUICKSTART.txt` to guide testing via `curl`, with example `.txt` articles.
- Support for `/run_goal` endpoint, combining plan generation and execution in one step.
- Automatic file creation logic for `license_keys.json` and `aiwaterdrops.json`.

### Fixed

- Agents now use `get_aiwaterdrops()` instead of `load_aiwaterdrops()` to properly track consumption.
- `summarize_articles` and `fetch_articles` now consistently report and persist water usage.
- LLM system prompt updated to avoid generating hallucinated agent names or capabilities.

### Documentation

- Updated all agent and orchestrator `README.md` files:
  - clarified required folders and files (`memory/`, `license_keys.json`)
  - added endpoint usage examples
  - listed accurate waterdrop costs
- Enhanced clarity on how to run manual tests with expected JSON outputs.

- Enhanced traceability in `/execute_plan` with improved execution logging
- Natural language goal-to-plan generation via Mistral LLM API

### Changed
