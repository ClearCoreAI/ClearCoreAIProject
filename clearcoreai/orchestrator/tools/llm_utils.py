Module: llm_utils
Component: Orchestrator Tool
Purpose: AI Planning Utility via Mistral API

Description:
This utility module enables the ClearCoreAI orchestrator to convert
a high-level user goal into an executable plan by leveraging the
Mistral LLM API. It introspects the available agents and guides the
language model to generate a coherent sequence of actions.

Philosophy:
- Inputs must be validated early to ensure safety.
- Outputs must be simple, reliable, and traceable.
- The metaphor of 'waterdrops' is used to quantify energy/resource usage.
- The LLM must only use real agents known to the orchestrator.
- No speculative output or hallucinated agents are accepted.

Initial State:
- license_keys.json is present and contains a valid Mistral API key
- At least one agent is registered in the orchestrator with a valid manifest
- A user-defined goal is provided as a non-empty string

Final State:
- A deterministic and syntactically valid plan is returned as a string
- Only real agents and capabilities from the registry are used
- The plan can be parsed and executed step-by-step by the orchestrator
- The orchestrator's waterdrop counter is incremented

Version: 0.3.0
Validated by: Olivier Hays
Date: 2025-06-20

Estimated Water Cost:
- 1 waterdrop per planning request (fixed)

    """
    Summary:
        Generates an execution plan to fulfill a user-defined goal using registered agents,
        by calling the Mistral API and returning a structured plan.

    Parameters:
        goal (str): A clear description of the user's objective.
        agents_registry (dict): Agent metadata including names and capabilities.
        license_keys (dict): API credentials containing the Mistral key.

    Returns:
        tuple[str, int]: A step-by-step plan and its energy cost (in waterdrops).

    Initial State:
        - 'goal' is a non-empty string
        - 'agents_registry' is a non-empty dictionary of agents with valid manifests
        - A valid Mistral API key is loaded from license_keys.json

    Final State:
        - A deterministic plan is returned in textual form (e.g., "1. agent ‚Üí capability")
        - The plan exclusively uses declared agents and capabilities
        - The plan is ready to be parsed and executed by the orchestrator
        - 1 waterdrop is consumed and recorded

    Raises:
        ValueError ‚Äî If inputs are malformed or no agents are available.
        Exception ‚Äî For network or API-related failures.

    Water Cost:
        - Fixed cost of 1 waterdrop per planning.

    You are a planning assistant for an AI orchestration system.
    Your task is to generate a strictly step-by-step execution plan to fulfill a user goal using ONLY the available agents and capabilities listed below.

    üß† Available agents and their capabilities:
    {agent_description}

    ‚ö†Ô∏è VERY IMPORTANT RULES:
    - You must use ONLY the agents and capabilities listed above.
    - Use the exact name of the agent as shown above.
    - Use the exact name of the capability as shown above.
    - The format of each step MUST be:

      agent_name ‚Üí capability_name

    - NEVER invert the order. The agent MUST be on the left of the arrow (‚Üí), and the capability MUST be on the right.
    - NEVER invent new agents or capabilities.
    - NEVER add explanations, comments, or formatting outside the plan.

    üéØ Your response must ONLY be the plan steps in this format:
    1. agent_name ‚Üí capability_name
    2. agent_name ‚Üí capability_name
    3. agent_name ‚Üí capability_name
