Module: llm_utils
Component: Orchestrator Tool
Purpose: AI Planning Utility via Mistral API

Description:
This utility module enables the ClearCoreAI orchestrator to convert
a high-level user goal into an executable plan by leveraging the
Mistral LLM API. It introspects the available agents and guides the
language model to generate a coherent sequence of actions.

Philosophy:
- Inputs must be validated early to ensure safety.
- Outputs must be simple, reliable, and traceable.
- The metaphor of 'waterdrops' is used to quantify energy/resource usage.
- The LLM must only use real agents known to the orchestrator.
- No speculative output or hallucinated agents are accepted.

Initial State:
- license_keys.json is present and contains a valid Mistral API key
- At least one agent is registered in the orchestrator with a valid manifest
- A user-defined goal is provided as a non-empty string

Final State:
- A deterministic and syntactically valid plan is returned as a string
- Only real agents and capabilities from the registry are used
- The plan can be parsed and executed step-by-step by the orchestrator

Version: 0.2.1
Validated by: Olivier Hays
Date: 2025-06-15

Estimated Water Cost:
- 1 waterdrop per planning request (fixed)

    Generates a plan to achieve a user-defined goal using registered agents.

    Parameters:
        goal (str): A clear description of the user's objective.
        agents_registry (dict): Agent metadata including names and capabilities.

    Returns:
        tuple[str, int]: A step-by-step plan and its energy cost (in waterdrops).

    Initial State:
        - 'goal' is a non-empty string
        - 'agents_registry' is a non-empty dictionary of agents with valid manifests
        - A valid Mistral API key is loaded from license_keys.json

    Final State:
        - A deterministic plan is returned in textual form (e.g., "1. agent ‚Üí capability")
        - The plan exclusively uses declared agents and capabilities
        - The plan is ready to be parsed and executed by the orchestrator
        - 1 waterdrop is consumed

    Raises:
        ValueError: If inputs are malformed or no agents are available.
        Exception: For API or unexpected errors.

    Water Cost:
        - Fixed cost of 1 waterdrop per planning.
