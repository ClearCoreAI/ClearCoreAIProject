Module: summarize_articles
Component: Agent API
Purpose: Summarize a list of articles using the Mistral LLM

Description:
This ClearCoreAI agent exposes a REST API to receive articles, summarize them using the Mistral API,
and return concise summaries. It supports declarative capability exposure via a manifest, mood tracking,
waterdrop accounting, and full compatibility with the orchestratorâ€™s execution pipeline.

Philosophy:
- Inputs are explicitly validated to ensure content quality and prevent errors.
- Summarization is modular and delegated to a utility layer.
- All state changes (e.g., mood) are saved in JSON for transparency.
- Only declared capabilities are exposed to the orchestrator.
- Execution follows deterministic rules for auditable pipelines.

Initial State:
- `manifest.json` is present and valid
- `mood.json` exists or is initialized to default mood
- `license_keys.json` is present and contains a valid Mistral API key
- The FastAPI server is launched and ready to accept orchestrated or manual requests

Final State:
- Agent responds to all declared endpoints
- Summarization is performed on input content and tracked
- Mood state is updated and persisted
- Waterdrop usage is tracked per summary and exposed via `/metrics`

Version: 0.2.1
Validated by: Olivier Hays
Date: 2025-06-20

Estimated Water Cost:
- 1 waterdrop per /health call
- ~2 waterdrops per /summarize call (variable per article count)
- 0.02 waterdrops per /execute dispatch
