Module: orchestrator
Component: Central Orchestrator API
Purpose: Core routing and coordination layer for ClearCoreAI

Description:
This orchestrator exposes the REST API and manages all agent coordination within ClearCoreAI.
It enables agent registration, manifest validation, capability discovery, compatibility checking,
plan generation, and full pipeline execution. All operations follow a traceable and deterministic
model compatible with multi-agent orchestration.

Philosophy:
- The orchestrator must only work with agents declared and validated through their manifest.
- Each step must be auditable and reproducible from input to output.
- All failures should return clear, structured messages to calling clients.
- Execution plans must use only compatible agent capabilities based on declared I/O specs.
- Energy usage is expressed in waterdrops to measure execution cost.

Initial State:
- `manifest_template.json` is present and valid
- `license_keys.json` is present and contains required API keys
- Agents may be pre-registered in `agents.json` or dynamically added
- The FastAPI server is launched and ready to accept connections

Final State:
- Agents are validated and stored in memory and on disk
- Connections between agents are inferred based on I/O spec compatibility
- Plans are generated via LLM and executed across agents in sequence
- All state changes and plan steps are returned as structured logs

Version: 0.3.0
Validated by: Olivier Hays
Date: 2025-06-15

Estimated Water Cost:
- 0.2 waterdrops per /register_agent
- 0.05 waterdrops per /agents or /manifest call
- 3 waterdrops per complete planning and execution pipeline (/run_goal)
